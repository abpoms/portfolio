                At sixteen, I taught myself how to program interactive physics simulations. In college I assisted in research computing geometry proofs under Dr. Zhendong Su, secured a competitive internship at Intel’s Graphics Software Validation group, built interactive tools in the Direct2D group at Microsoft, and led the Computer Science student organization. I turned down offers from Microsoft and LinkedIn and withdrew from UC Davis at the beginning of my 3rd year to found a startup in SF. There, I implemented current distributed systems papers on CRDTs and fell back in love with academic research. I am particularly interested in new forms of computational output and input, such as VR, AR, Computational Photography, and novel input mechanisms, and further exploration of CRDTs to allow wider use in industry systems. I am looking for a position as a research assistant or intern in a group that’s investigating these areas.

                    <p>
                        Nibbol is a website that allows pet owners to find a
                        veterinarian in their area, browse their available times,
                        and then instantly book an appointment online. I led
                        the engineering for the project and built the server
                        side code and parts of the javascript frontend.

                    <p>
                        In this expose I am going to cover the details of the
                        CRDT based scheduling system that I built. I will give
                        a brief summary of what a CRDT is, how it is used in
                        the scheduling system, what the network topology is,
                        and how the data propagates through the system.

                    <h3>Brief on Distributed Systems & CRDTs</h3>

                    <p>
                        Due to the CAP theorem, a distributed system cannot be
                        both fully consistent and always available. When a
                        system has users, it is generally better to always be
                        available and sacrifice some total consistency. This
                        was most definitely the case for the scheduling system
                        that I built for Nibbol; the veterinarians using the
                        system have hectic schedules and can't afford to wait
                        around for a lost internet connection or disabled
                        server. One method for accomplishing this is by
                        adopting an eventual consistency model. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventual consistency is a consistency model that
                        guarantees all accesess to a piece of data will
                        eventually return the last updated value but does not
                        necessarily dictate when accesses will return the most
                        recently updated value. Designing a data model that
                        actually provides eventually consistent properties
                        is error-prone and can have disasterous results if
                        not implemented correctly (woops, there goes all my
                        users business critical records). Thankfully, CRDTs
                        provide a simple, mathematically provable approach
                        to desgining a distributed, eventually consistent data
                        type.

                    <p>
                        CRDT stands for convergent or commutative replicated
                        data type. A CRDT is a data representation that, under
                        a few mathematical properties, ensures replicas
                        (representations of the same data stored on multiple
                        devices) have eventual consistency. For Nibbol, I used
                        a state-based CRDT: a form of CRDT that converges by
                        merging with other replicas under a set of rules to
                        form an updated version which incorporates changes
                        from both children.

            <!-- Without any background in distributed systems research,
                 I read through current CRDT research papers and several
                 other foundational distributed systems papers to immerse
                 myself in the prevailing theory. This was my first foray
                 into understanding the implications of a fundamentally
                 distributed system.

                    <p>
                        In order for Nibbol to display the veterinarian's
                        available times for appointments, it had to know which
                        times were already booked. The times which are booked
                        by clients was the most frequently changing piece of
                        data in the system; it was really important that the
                        veterinarian was never restricted from modifying
                        the booked times. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to represent the available appointment times as
                        CRDTs because of several observations I made. I realized
                        that the veterinarians are used to using software that is
                        hosted on-premise and so they expect fairly low latency
                        in response to actions. On-premise software also has the
                        benefit of not being disabled by a shaky internet
                        connection. CRDTs perfectly counter these issues. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a CRDT based system, one does not have to wait for
                        the server to confirm an action: it can be applied
                        instantly and synchronized later. As CRDTs don't have
                        to wait for the server to perform useful work, users
                        can still utilize the system when they experience
                        complete internet loss.

                        Each blocked time was represented by three different
                        properties: a start time, end time, and a recurrence
                        rule. The start and end time both occured on the same
                        day and indicated the time period that should be
                        blocked. The reccurence rule was used to repeat blocked
                        times to avoid repetitious input.

                        In addition to those three properties, each block was

                        clocks, and a boolean flag indicating deletion. One
                        lamport clock was for the start and end time and one
                        was for the reccurence rule.

                                update.

                                Scheduler server receives notification that there
                                is a new entry in the update journal and about
                                the update, and schedules a worker to sweep the
                                update journal to persist the new changes to
                                PostgreSQL for storage.

                                After some interval, the scheduler fires off a
                                notification for a worker to sweep the update queue.
                            </li>

                                The worker grabs the most recent additions to
                                the update queue and the canonical state stored
                                in PostgreSQL.

                                The worker combines all the updates and then
                                stores them in PostgreSQL.

                                If the worker finds that the update queue has not
                                changed since the last sweep, it informs the
                                scheduler to stop sending sweep notifications.

                     <h2>Backend Design</h2>
                     <p>
                         The Nibbol backend server provides two APIs: one for the
                         consumer facing web app and one for the veterinarian
                         facing scheduler. A client accesses these APIs by sending
                         requests to www.nibbol.com/api/o/... for the consumer API
                         or vet.nibbol.com/api/v/... for the veterinarian API.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        These APIs are provided on different domains so that the
                        load from the consumer side and the veterinarian side
                        can be decoupled from each other. I made this architecture
                        choice because I figured veterinarians are relying on their
                        end of the software to have a very high uptime. If the
                        consumer side web tier becomes overloaded, the veterinarian
                        users should not experience any slower response times
                        unless the consumer demand is also affecting parts of
                        the system which both APIs share, such as the shared
                        storage services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When requests are sent to the web facing domain names, they
                        first hit the load balancers in front of the web tier.
                        These load balancers distribute requests across the
                        stateless web tier to allow the service to easily scale
                        up. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inside the internal network, there are a collection of
                        stateful services which house the data for the system,
                        a tier of worker instances that handle tasks, and
                        a singleton scheduler instance that fires off jobs
                        at requested times and intervals.

                            their information changes. Instead of restricting
                            database access to someone who is technical, I built
                            a service that would push portions of a database into
                            a shared google spreadsheet and then pull back changes
                            into the database at some interval. This allowed
                            non-technical employees to edit the data thus
                            eliminating a bottleneck.

                    <p>
                        Direct2D is Microsoft's graphics API for hardware
                        accelerated 2D rendering. During my summer internship
                        on the Direct2D team, I designed and built an interactive
                        test reproduction and diagnosis tool. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Key Points</h3>

                        <li>
                            Decreases feedback loop by allowing on-figure
                            modification of the underlying Direct2D API calls.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            Displays exactly what is being rendered in the scene
                            and which resources exist on the GPU in side panels
                            so the user always has full control.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Setup code architecture so that new API versions
                            could be supported easily.

                        <li>
                            Replicates scene across multiple API implementations
                            so the user can see discrepancies between them.

                    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                    <p>
                        Going into the project, I developed four guiding design
                        principles that I determined were most important to
                        building a successful, lasting, and relevant final
                        artifact. I believe it was vital that these design
                        principles be laid out explicity so that whoever
                        picked up the project after me could continue the spirit
                        of the effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The design principles I created for this project were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Control</li>
                            <li>Interactivity</li>
                            <li>Reproducibility</li>
                            <li>Maintainability</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered these design principles from consulting with
                        the future users of the tool (the other developers on my
                        team) and through several implementation iterations.

                    <h2>Reproducibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a reproduction and diagnosis tool, reproducibility is
                        the most important principle. To make sure a test scene
                        can be reproduced it is necessary that the program
                        isolates its own resources from those of the test scene,
                        exposes all of the resources that are part of the scene,
                        allows saving and loading for sharing a setup, and supports
                        exporting the scene as stand-alone code.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Resource Isolation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Resource isolation is the explicit separation of GPU
                        resources utilized for drawing the tool itself and
                        for constructing the test scene that is meant to
                        display the visual artifact. I realized that I needed to
                        make sure that any resources being used to display parts
                        of the tool needed to be able to be unloaded from the
                        GPU so there is no interference with the test case.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Resource Exposure</h4>
                    <p>
                        Deriving the minimal test case which manifests a bug
                        is critical to allowing a swift fix to the offending
                        code. A user can not be sure that he has the minimal test
                        case unless he knows exactly what resources are being
                        utilized in the scene. The user interface of the tool
                        was thus designed so that every API call and resource
                        created on the GPU is exposed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Sharing</h4>
                    <p>
                        After developing the test case inside the tool it's
                        important that the test setup can be shared with
                        others, especially those who are responsible for
                        writing the fix for the code. I built saving and loading 
                        into the tool from the ground up so every element of
                        the scene could be whisked to another developer. This
                        is especially useful for attaching to bug tickets
                        so the developer can see the issue and play around
                        with it themselves.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Code Export</h4>
                    <p>
                        While saving and loading is very useful for sharing a
                        test case, it limits the platforms the test case can
                        run on to those which run the DrawD2D tool. A test case
                        should be able to run on any platform that has a Direct2D
                        implementation. To solve this, I built facilities for
                        exporting the entire scene as Direct2D rendering code. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I knew that the audience for this tool would be highly
                        technical developers who have a propensity for code
                        over using GUIs as GUIs tend to hide details from the
                        user. I didn't want to build a tool that would sit
                        unused because the users felt like they were
                        restricted when using it. The control design principle
                        addresses this by forcing every switch and knob to
                        be exposed. Balancing UI design best practices with
                        the need to expose the complexity of the Direct2D
                        API proved an interesting challenge. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>GUI Segmentation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Direct2D is mainly composed of graphics resources, such
                        as brushes, geometries, and bitmaps, and draw calls,
                        such as rectangles, bezier curves, and text. Each of
                        these elements had to be displayed somewhere in the UI.
                        I devised the GUI segmentation to provide common areas
                        for the different Direct2D elements so that the user
                        could easily. This segmentation also proved to help
                        guide future maintainers in placing new Direct2D
                        features in the UI and thus preserve the coherency
                        of the design.

                    <h4>Fine-grained Attributes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every Direct2D draw call and resource has a plethora of
                        options that can be altered. I created a framework that
                        makes it easy to expose these attributes in the
                        Resource dock and Rendering sidepanel (as visible in
                        the figure to the right). This framework includes
                        numerical inputs for numbers, dropdowns inputs for
                        a list of options and more.

                        The status quo before my tool for reproducing visual
                        bugs consisted of either directly writing rendering
                        code that could reproduce the issue or utilizing a
                        dated tool which let the user load an xml file
                        describing the scene. In both cases the user must
                        context switch between editing the scene and viewing
                        it. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>On-figure controls</h4>
                    <p>
                        While editing the individual attributes of a draw call
                        allows for great accuracy, it can be quite tedious and
                        forces the user to perform a binary search to narrow
                        down on a bug. On-figure controls are an alternative
                        that gives the user the ability to intuitively modify 
                        the rendered result and see how these modifications
                        For example, if the scene was rendering a bezier curve
                        then the user could select the bezier curve and
                        individually modify the control points instead of
                        editing their X-Y attributes individually.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Instantaneous feedback</h4>
                    <p>
                        Closing the loop from when an edit is made and the
                        effect is seen was a huge priority for this project.
                        The smaller the feedback loop the faster one can
                        diagnose and discover bugs. To that end, every
                        adjustment of an attribute, be it via the fine-grained
                        attributes on the side panels or on-figure
                        modification, instantly and constantly updated the
                        scene.

                    <p>
                        As the project was being built solely by myself, one of the
                        driving goals was to ensure that it could provide long-term
                        use once my internship had ended. New versions of
                        Direct2D were inevitable and I knew updating DrawD2D to
                        support those would be a low priority task.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Extension points</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first structural decision was to sufficiently abstract
                        the extension points on the system to provide the simplest
                        possible object interfaces for a maintainer, even at the
                        cost of some implementation complexity elsewhere in the
                        code. This would allow someone to jump in and add new
                        features, significantly increasing the chances of
                        maintenance in a hectic engineering organization.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Boilerplate generation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second initiative was to modify an in-house
                        code generation tool to export skeleton class
                        implementations for new features that were added to
                        Direct2D. This would reduce the boilerplate that would
                        be needed to be implemented for each new Direct2D feature
                        and allow a maintainer to focus only on the unique
                        aspects of that specific feature.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Detailed guide</h4>
                    <p>
                        To support these two decisions I created a design document
                        that detailed the exact steps one would need to do to add
                        a new Direct2D feature, including running the code
                        generator and the specifics of the extension points.

                    <p>
                        Although not one of the principles, scene replication was
                        a feature I was particularly proud of thinking up and
                        implementing.

                    <p>
                        Direct2D is fundamentally about hardware acceleration
                        of 2D graphics. Unfortunately that means that clever
                        optimizations to decrease rendering cycles can introduce
                        graphical artifacts in a specific implementation that only
                        manifest in complicated end-user code. Fortunately, there
                        is a reference implementation that, while extremely slow,
                        always produces the correct scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To verify that a specific scene has a visual artifact in
                        it requires that a user compare it to the reference
                        implementation. The trivial way to support this would be
                        to add a dropdown box that listed all the Direct2D
                        implementations available on the system. However, this
                        requires the user to constantly flip back and forth to
                        verify a bug and also defeats the advantage of the
                        interactive components of the tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a solution, I setup the object interfaces and code
                        architecture such that all implementations of the
                        extensions points in the system did not hold onto Direct2D
                        resources directly but instead handed them off to a
                        resource manager that handled every part of their
                        lifecycle. This allowed the system to support multiple
                        simultaneous graphics implementations to display identical
                        scenes next to each other by instantiating new instances
                        of the Direct2D resources from the canonical object
                        interfaces.
